One way to curb these issues is to install allegation escrow systems that allow victims to report such incidents. The escrows are responsible for identifying victims of a common perpetrator and taking the necessary action to bring justice to them. However, users hesitate to participate in these systems due to the fear of such sensitive reports being leaked to perpetrators, who may further misuse them. Thus, to increase trust in the system, cryptographic solutions are being designed to realize secure allegation escrow (SAE) systems. \n\nIn the work of Arun et al. (NDSS'20), which presents the state-of-the-art solution, we identify attacks that can leak sensitive information and compromise victim privacy. We also report issues present in prior works that were left unidentified. To arrest all these breaches, we put forth an SAE system that prevents the identified attacks and retains the salient features from all prior works. The cryptographic technique of secure multi-party computation (MPC) serves as the primary underlying tool in designing our system. At the heart of our system lies a new duplicity check protocol and an improved matching protocol. We also provide additional features such as allegation modification and deletion, which were absent in the state of the art.

However, there has been little work on provably inferring k from the data. In this talk, I shall describe polynomial time algorithms for fi€nding k from the data assuming it satisfies certain natural deterministic conditions. Informally, we assume that there is a Ground Truth (GT) clustering of the data with the following properties: (i) Each cluster has a certain minimum size, (ii) the inter-mean separation of any two distinct clusters in the GT is large enough (although still weaker than what is typically assumed in the literature), and (iii) we define a novel “no large sub-cluster”(NLSC) property that characterizes the notion of a cluster\nby stipulating that there be no subsets of low “directional variance”. NLSC is indeed satisfied by a large class of distributions including log-concave densities.

In addition, a unique stable marriage in this market simplifies a host of downstream desiderata. In this paper, we explore a new set of sufficient conditions for unique stable matching (USM) under this setup. Unlike other approaches that also address this question using the structure of preference profiles, we use an algorithmic viewpoint and investigate if this question can be answered using the lens of the deferred acceptance (DA) algorithm (Gale and Shapley, 1962). Our results yield a set of sufficient conditions for USM (viz., MaxProp and MaxRou) and show that these are disjoint from the previously known sufficiency conditions like sequential preference and no crossing. We also provide a characterization of MaxProp that makes it efficiently verifiable, and shows the gap between MaxProp and the entire USM class. These results give a more detailed view of the sub-structures of the USM class.\n\nThis is a joint work with Kartik Gokhale, Amit Kumar Mallik, and Ankit Kumar Misra. \n\n[Slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/10DClCFmC1PRbzBDeHX4dUT8hNgIlodvfHpRKEDmVr4c/edit?usp=sharing) · [ArXiV](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.18736)\n:::\n\n:::{.callout-tip icon=\"false\" collapse=\"true\"}\n# About the Speaker · Swaprava Nath\n\nSwaprava is an Assistant Professor at the Department of Computer Science and Engineering, IIT Bombay.

In addition, a unique stable marriage in this market simplifies a host of downstream desiderata. In this paper, we explore a new set of sufficient conditions for unique stable matching (USM) under this setup. Unlike other approaches that also address this question using the structure of preference profiles, we use an algorithmic viewpoint and investigate if this question can be answered using the lens of the deferred acceptance (DA) algorithm (Gale and Shapley, 1962). Our results yield a set of sufficient conditions for USM (viz., MaxProp and MaxRou) and show that these are disjoint from the previously known sufficiency conditions like sequential preference and no crossing. We also provide a characterization of MaxProp that makes it efficiently verifiable, and shows the gap between MaxProp and the entire USM class. These results give a more detailed view of the sub-structures of the USM class.\n\nThis is a joint work with Kartik Gokhale, Amit Kumar Mallik, and Ankit Kumar Misra. \n\n[Slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/10DClCFmC1PRbzBDeHX4dUT8hNgIlodvfHpRKEDmVr4c/edit?usp=sharing) · [ArXiV](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.18736)\n:::\n\n:::{.callout-tip icon=\"false\" collapse=\"true\"}\n# About the Speaker · Swaprava Nath\n\nSwaprava is an Assistant Professor at the Department of Computer Science and Engineering, IIT Bombay. Before this, he was a faculty member at the Dept. of CSE, IIT Kanpur. Even earlier, he held postdoctoral positions at Carnegie Mellon University and Indian Statistical Institute, New Delhi, and finished his PhD from the Dept. of CSA, IISc Bangalore. His research interest lies at the intersection of economics and computation, which has several applications in social and industrial paradigms (for details, please see his [CompEcon group page](https://www.cse.iitb.ac.in/~swaprava/group.html) and his [research page](https://www.cse.iitb.ac.in/~swaprava/research.html)). His work has been published in top AI and multiagent systems conferences, e.g., AAAI, IJCAI, AAMAS, WINE, and also in economics and management venues, e.g., Games and Econ Behavior, Economics Letters, Management Science. Apart from academic positions, Swaprava also has experience in the industry. He has worked at Xerox Research Centre Europe and Cisco Systems India. He has been recipients of Fulbright-Nehru postdoctoral grant, Tata Consultancy Services PhD Fellowship, and the Honorable Mention Award of Yahoo! Key Scientific Challenges Program.\n:::\n\n\n:::\n<!-- end panel
