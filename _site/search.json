It has therefore borrowed and tracked various paradigms of programming and systems engineering in the course of its development and also introduced niche paradigms of its own. The domain offers a unique way to engage with computing for those with some ties to music, and vice versa. Teaching a class with students having diverse capabilities and interests therefore poses interesting challenges of individual development and group work. For context, I’ll present some of the history of the domain and the modes of thinking that the field has employed, with a sample of various “languages”, systems and methods in use. I’ll then bring up some challenges of teaching it to a class, primarily around how to get students comfortable crossing the left-right brain divide.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbout the Speaker · Srikumar Subramanian\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n02-02-2024 · 3PM to 4PM · Functional Programming with Haskell – A Teaser\n\n\n\n\n\nWe provide a quick tour of the functional programming language Haskell, touching on the highlights like pattern matching, polymorphism, higher-order functions etc. We will focus on laziness, an essential feature that sets it apart from other functional languages, and two examples that illustrate how laziness helps in writing simple programs for complex tasks.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbout the Speaker · S P Suresh\n\n\n\n\n\nS P Suresh is on the faculty of Theoretical Computer Science at the Chennai Mathematical Institute. His research interests include logic in computer science, concurrency and distributed computing, and formal methods for security. He did his PhD at the Institute of Mathematical Sciences with Jam.\nHis other interests include classical Indian logic and epistemology, Carnatic music, chess, and P G Wodehouse. And his mission in life is to prove beautiful theorems and present them in beautifully typeset papers!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n02-02-2024 · 4:30PM to 5:30PM · Programming Before You Program\n\n\n\n\n\nProgramming education, seemingly obviously, focuses on the writing of programs. But when novices struggle with programming, a lot of their difficulty is not with the program per se. What else is there? What do we know about it? And how can we make their experience better? This talk summarizes computing education research that asks and answers these questions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbout the Speaker · Shriram Krishnamurthi\n\n\n\n\n\nShriram is the Vice President for Programming Languages at Brown University in Providence, RI, USA. He’s not, really, but that’s what it says on his business card. At heart, he’s a person of ill-repute: a Schemer, Racketeer, and Pyreteer. He believes tropical fruit are superior to all other kinds. He is terrified of success, because he may be forced to buy a suit. He is known to interrogate his audiences to ensure they’re paying attention. So, be alert.

I will review some classical results on the structural and game-theoretic aspects of the stable matching problem, discuss some recent developments (specifically, in capacity modification and preference manipulation), and highlight some open problems.\nBased on joint works with Hadi Hosseini and Fatima Umar, and with Salil Gokhale, Shivika Narang, and Samarth Singla.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbout the Speaker · Rohit Vaish\n\n\n\n\n\nRohit Vaish is an Assistant Professor in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering at Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Delhi and an associate faculty at Yardi School of Artificial Intelligence.

    "text": "Past Talks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n05-01-2024 · Understanding Problems Before Programming\n\n\n\nNovice programmers often begin coding with a poor understanding of the task at hand and end up solving the wrong problem. To combat this, students are often asked to explain the problem in their own words. What words can students use meaningfully, how can we provide automated feedback, and how can we make this feedback maximally useful? This talk presents concrete solutions to all these problems.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbout the Speaker · Siddhartha Prasad\n\n\n\nSiddhartha Prasad is a PhD student at Brown University, working on formal methods, education, and programming languages. His current research aims to help programmers better understand the problems they are solving. Previously, he was a software engineer at Microsoft, working on Azure Cognitive Services and the XAML UI framework.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n29-12-2023 · How many Clusters ? - An Algorithmic Answer\n\n\n\nMany algorithms for clustering high dimensional data assume that k, the number of clusters, is given. However, there has been little work on provably inferring k from the data. In this talk, I shall describe polynomial time algorithms for fi€nding k from the data assuming it satisfies certain natural deterministic conditions. Informally, we assume that there is a Ground Truth (GT) clustering of the data with the following properties: (i) Each cluster has a certain minimum size, (ii) the inter-mean separation of any two distinct clusters in the GT is large enough (although still weaker than what is typically assumed in the literature), and (iii) we define a novel “no large sub-cluster”(NLSC) property that characterizes the notion of a cluster by stipulating that there be no subsets of low “directional variance”. NLSC is indeed satisfied by a large class of distributions including log-concave densities. This is joint work with Chiranjib Bhattacharyya and Ravindran Kannan.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbout the Speaker · Amit Kumar\n\n\n\nAmit Kumar is Professor in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering at the Indian Institute of Technology Delhi. He received his B.Tech. degree from Indian Institute of Technology Kanpur in 1997, and Ph.D. from Cornell University in 2002. He worked as Member of Technical Staff at Bell Labs, Murray Hill, New Jersey, U.S. during 2002–2003. He joined IIT Delhi as faculty member in 2003. He works in the area of combinatorial optimization, approximation algorithms and online algorithms. He is working extensively on problems arising in scheduling theory, clustering, and graph theoretic algorithmic problems.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n22-12-2023 · A Gale-Shapley View of Unique Stable Marriages\n\n\n\nStable marriage of a two-sided market with unit demand is a classic problem that arises in many real-world scenarios. In addition, a unique stable marriage in this market simplifies a host of downstream desiderata. In this paper, we explore a new set of sufficient conditions for unique stable matching (USM) under this setup. Unlike other approaches that also address this question using the structure of preference profiles, we use an algorithmic viewpoint and investigate if this question can be answered using the lens of the deferred acceptance (DA) algorithm (Gale and Shapley, 1962). Our results yield a set of sufficient conditions for USM (viz., MaxProp and MaxRou) and show that these are disjoint from the previously known sufficiency conditions like sequential preference and no crossing. We also provide a characterization of MaxProp that makes it efficiently verifiable, and shows the gap between MaxProp and the entire USM class. These results give a more detailed view of the sub-structures of the USM class.\nThis is a joint work with Kartik Gokhale, Amit Kumar Mallik, and Ankit Kumar Misra.\nSlides · ArXiV\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbout the Speaker · Swaprava Nath\n\n\n\nSwaprava is an Assistant Professor at the Department of Computer Science and Engineering, IIT Bombay. Before this, he was a faculty member at the Dept. of CSE, IIT Kanpur. Even earlier, he held postdoctoral positions at Carnegie Mellon University and Indian Statistical Institute, New Delhi, and finished his PhD from the Dept. of CSA, IISc Bangalore. His research interest lies at the intersection of economics and computation, which has several applications in social and industrial paradigms (for details, please see his CompEcon group page and his research page). His work has been published in top AI and multiagent systems conferences, e.g., AAAI, IJCAI, AAMAS, WINE, and also in economics and management venues, e.g., Games and Econ Behavior, Economics Letters, Management Science. Apart from academic positions, Swaprava also has experience in the industry. He has worked at Xerox Research Centre Europe and Cisco Systems India.
