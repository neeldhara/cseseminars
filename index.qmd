# `05-01-2024` · Understanding Problems Before Programming

Novice programmers often begin coding with a poor understanding of the task at hand and end up solving the wrong problem. To combat this, students are often asked to explain the problem in their own words. What words can students use meaningfully, how can we provide automated feedback, and how can we make this feedback maximally useful? This talk presents concrete solutions to all these problems.

# About the Speaker · Jyothi Krishnan

Jyothi Krishnan grew up solving puzzles and reading Martin Gardner’s books. Not realising that recreational mathematics provided any scope for a career, she pursued her other love of mechanics and collected a BTech from NIT Calicut, an MS from IIT Madras and a PhD from UC Berkeley. She has worked as a programmer, a bridge engineer, a research mathematician and a school teacher. Having been introduced to the world of modern board games during her PhD, she realised that it was a way to make fairly complicated mathematical reasoning accessible to a large number of children so she created a job playing games with kids in an alternative school in Bangalore. After running her game lab for 4 years she discovered like-minded people at CCL where she is thrilled to be making a living playing games and solving puzzles. At CCL she creates games and looks after math content.

# `02-02-2024` · `3PM to 4PM` · Functional Programming with Haskell -- A Teaser

We provide a quick tour of the functional programming language Haskell, touching on the highlights like pattern matching, polymorphism, higher-order functions etc. We will focus on laziness, an essential feature that sets it apart from other functional languages, and two examples that illustrate how laziness helps in writing simple programs for complex tasks.

# `02-02-2024` · `4:30PM to 5:30PM` · Programming Before You Program

Programming education, seemingly obviously, focuses on the writing of programs. But when novices struggle with programming, a lot of their difficulty is not with the program per se. What else is there? What do we know about it? And how can we make their experience better? This talk summarizes computing education research that asks and answers these questions.

# About the Speaker · Shriram Krishnamurthi

Shriram is the Vice President for Programming Languages at Brown University in Providence, RI, USA. He’s not, really, but that’s what it says on his business card. At heart, he's a person of ill-repute: a Schemer, Racketeer, and Pyreteer. He believes tropical fruit are superior to all other kinds. He is terrified of success, because he may be forced to buy a suit. He is known to interrogate his audiences to ensure they’re paying attention. So, be alert. You can read email later.

# `23-02-2024` · A Brief History of Stable Matchings and Some Open Problems

The stable matching problem asks to match two disjoints sets of agents, say students and schools, in a way that no pair of unmatched agents prefer to be matched with each other. I will review some classical results on the structural and game-theoretic aspects of the stable matching problem, discuss some recent developments (specifically, in capacity modification and preference manipulation), and highlight some open problems.

Based on joint works with Hadi Hosseini and Fatima Umar, and with Salil Gokhale, Shivika Narang, and Samarth Singla.

# About the Speaker · Rohit Vaish

Rohit Vaish is an Assistant Professor in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering at Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Delhi and an associate faculty at Yardi School of Artificial Intelligence. Previously, he was a postdoctoral researcher at Tata Institute of Fundamental Research (TIFR) and at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute (RPI), and prior to that, did his PhD from Indian Institute of Science (IISc).

Rohit's research is in the area of computational social choice, which is the study of collective decision-making problems from a computational lens. More generally, he enjoys thinking about problems at the interface of economics and computer science.

## Past Talks

# `29-12-2023` · How many Clusters ? - An Algorithmic Answer

Many algorithms for clustering high dimensional data assume that k, the number of clusters, is given. However, there has been little work on provably inferring k from the data. In this talk, I shall describe polynomial time algorithms for fi€nding k from the data assuming it satisfies certain natural deterministic conditions. Informally, we assume that there is a Ground Truth (GT) clustering of the data with the following properties: (i) Each cluster has a certain minimum size, (ii) the inter-mean separation of any two distinct clusters in the GT is large enough (although still weaker than what is typically assumed in the literature), and (iii) we define a novel “no large sub-cluster”(NLSC) property that characterizes the notion of a cluster
by stipulating that there be no subsets of low “directional variance”. NLSC is indeed satisfied by a large class of distributions including log-concave densities.  This is joint work with Chiranjib Bhattacharyya and Ravindran Kannan.

# `22-12-2023` · A Gale-Shapley View of Unique Stable Marriages

Stable marriage of a two-sided market with unit demand is a classic problem that arises in many real-world scenarios. In addition, a unique stable marriage in this market simplifies a host of downstream desiderata. In this paper, we explore a new set of sufficient conditions for unique stable matching (USM) under this setup. Unlike other approaches that also address this question using the structure of preference profiles, we use an algorithmic viewpoint and investigate if this question can be answered using the lens of the deferred acceptance (DA) algorithm (Gale and Shapley, 1962). Our results yield a set of sufficient conditions for USM (viz., MaxProp and MaxRou) and show that these are disjoint from the previously known sufficiency conditions like sequential preference and no crossing. We also provide a characterization of MaxProp that makes it efficiently verifiable, and shows the gap between MaxProp and the entire USM class. These results give a more detailed view of the sub-structures of the USM class.

This is a joint work with Kartik Gokhale, Amit Kumar Mallik, and Ankit Kumar Misra.
