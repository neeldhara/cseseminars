---

Welcome to the CSE Department Seminars for the Spring term of 2024! We are excited to announce an amazing lineup of speakers this semester. Unless mentioned otherwise:

- all talks are hybrid, and you can join us either at `7/101`^[The speakers are typically present in person.] if you are on campus, or over [Zoom](
https://iitgn-ac-in.zoom.us/j/5086558236?pwd=bXl6NXFpQURVWnJZaDJucUpqN3hUZz09&omn=94677480599)^[The passcode is `t____g`. This is the first word in the popular phrases `****** test` and `****** award`. ChatGPT knows the answer too.];
- are 50 minutes long, followed by 10 minutes of Q&A;
- and start on Fridays at 3:30PM.

Please feel free to reach out to me at `neeldhara.m@iitgn.ac.in` if you see an unclaimed Friday and would like to give a talk in this series!

# `22-12-2023` · A Gale-Shapley View of Unique Stable Marriages

Stable marriage of a two-sided market with unit demand is a classic problem that arises in many real-world scenarios. In addition, a unique stable marriage in this market simplifies a host of downstream desiderata. In this paper, we explore a new set of sufficient conditions for unique stable matching (USM) under this setup. Unlike other approaches that also address this question using the structure of preference profiles, we use an algorithmic viewpoint and investigate if this question can be answered using the lens of the deferred acceptance (DA) algorithm (Gale and Shapley, 1962). Our results yield a set of sufficient conditions for USM (viz., MaxProp and MaxRou) and show that these are disjoint from the previously known sufficiency conditions like sequential preference and no crossing. We also provide a characterization of MaxProp that makes it efficiently verifiable, and shows the gap between MaxProp and the entire USM class. These results give a more detailed view of the sub-structures of the USM class.

This is a joint work with Kartik Gokhale, Amit Kumar Mallik, and Ankit Kumar Misra.

# About the Speaker · Swaprava Nath

Swaprava is an Assistant Professor at the Department of Computer Science and Engineering, IIT Bombay. Before this, he was a faculty member at the Dept. of CSE, IIT Kanpur. Even earlier, he held postdoctoral positions at Carnegie Mellon University and Indian Statistical Institute, New Delhi, and finished his PhD from the Dept. of CSA, IISc Bangalore. His research interest lies at the intersection of economics and computation, which has several applications in social and industrial paradigms (for details, please see his [CompEcon group page](https://www.cse.iitb.ac.in/~swaprava/group.html) and his [research page](https://www.cse.iitb.ac.in/~swaprava/research.html)). His work has been published in top AI and multiagent systems conferences, e.g., AAAI, IJCAI, AAMAS, WINE, and also in economics and management venues, e.g., Games and Econ Behavior, Economics Letters, Management Science. Apart from academic positions, Swaprava also has experience in the industry. He has worked at Xerox Research Centre Europe and Cisco Systems India. He has been recipients of Fulbright-Nehru postdoctoral grant, Tata Consultancy Services PhD Fellowship, and the Honorable Mention Award of Yahoo! Key Scientific Challenges Program.

# About the Speaker · Jyothi Krishnan

Jyothi Krishnan grew up solving puzzles and reading Martin Gardner’s books. Not realising that recreational mathematics provided any scope for a career, she pursued her other love of mechanics and collected a BTech from NIT Calicut, an MS from IIT Madras and a PhD from UC Berkeley. She has worked as a programmer, a bridge engineer, a research mathematician and a school teacher. Having been introduced to the world of modern board games during her PhD, she realised that it was a way to make fairly complicated mathematical reasoning accessible to a large number of children so she created a job playing games with kids in an alternative school in Bangalore. After running her game lab for 4 years she discovered like-minded people at CCL where she is thrilled to be making a living playing games and solving puzzles. At CCL she creates games and looks after math content.

# About the Speaker · Shriram Krishnamurthi

Shriram is the Vice President for Programming Languages at Brown University in Providence, RI, USA. He’s not, really, but that’s what it says on his business card. At heart, he's a person of ill-repute: a Schemer, Racketeer, and Pyreteer. He believes tropical fruit are superior to all other kinds. He is terrified of success, because he may be forced to buy a suit. He is known to interrogate his audiences to ensure they’re paying attention. So, be alert. You can read email later.
